# Home_Sales
GTPE Data Analytics Boot Camp Module 22 Challenge

Repository contains
  Home_Sales.ipynb, a Jupyter notebook file (made in Google Colab) that pulls data located here: https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.2/22-big-data/home_sales_revised.csv
  A Starter_Code folder containing course-provided starter code as well as a home_sales_revised.csv pulled from the above URL (just for me to look at and check for headers)
